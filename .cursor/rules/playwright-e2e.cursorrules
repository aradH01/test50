  "rules": [
    "Use test.describe to group related tests by page or feature.",
    "Always use data-testid attributes for selectors.",
    "Test user flows: login, navigation, form submissions, and critical paths.",
    "Tests should be deterministic and isolated; do not rely on previous test state.",
    "Include setup and teardown when necessary (beforeAll, afterAll).",
    "E2E tests must run in CI/CD and pass before merging PRs.",
    "E2E tests must reflect real user flows and avoid flaky waits.",
    "Always link test cases to Xray/TestRail IDs if available.",
    "Never duplicate Cypress and Playwright tests for the same case unless explicitly asked."
